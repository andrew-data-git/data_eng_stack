# Data Engineering personal project

### Develop a simple data pipeline, that is automated and uses a modern technology stack.

This should be:
* Version controlled
* Implemented with CI/CD principles
* Use containerised services

The stack will be mainly implemented with shell, and data engineering with python.
Completion of such a task should enable me to reproduce this work in real projects.

# TODO 1
* get raw data of weather
* create a simple python etl pipeline
* dockerise this

# TODO 2 - branch off
* pull from a weather API
* batch ingest with py requests
* load to a postgres db
* transform with dbt
* orchestrated via airflow
* visualised with superset
