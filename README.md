# Data Engineering personal project

### Develop a simple data pipeline, that is automated and uses a modern technology stack.

This should be:
* Version controlled
* Implemented with CI/CD principles
* Use containerised services

The stack will be mainly implemented with shell, and data engineering with python.

Completion of such a task should enable me to reproduce this work in real projects.
